This artifact is a set of files accompanying the paper "A Multi-Region 
Investigation of the Perceptions and Use of Smart Home Devices" by Patrick 
Bombik, Tom Wenzel, Jens Grossklags, and Sameer Patil published in the 
Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PoPETS).

The set contains the following files:
- README: This file.
- shd_responses_data.csv: The data in CSV format containing the valid 
responses to the questionnaire used in the research and provided in the 
Appendix of the paper.
- shd_responses_codebook.pdf: A codebook for the data that includes a list 
of all variables along with the corresponding questions from the 
questionnaire and the values for the possible answer choices.
- shd_responses_analysis.R: The R script used to process and analyze the 
data to generate the results reported in the paper.


Running the shd_responses_analysis.R file requires the following:
- A working installation of the R language that can be invoked from the 
command line.  Installation files and instructions for R can be obtained 
from: https://www.r-project.org/ 
Alternatively, the script can be run within any IDE that supports R, 
such as RStudio (https://www.rstudio.com/)
- R packages: 1. dplyr; 2. doBy; 3. FSA; 4. formattable. If not already 
installed,  the packages can be installed from the command line with 
the command install.packages('packagename') where packagename is the name of 
the package to be installed. 
Alternatively, the packages can be installed with the appropriate menu 
selections  from the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of an IDE, such as Studio.
- Specifying the local file path for the data file 
(i.e., shd_responses_data.csv)  by replacing "/PATH/TO/" in the command 
read.csv("/PATH/TO/shd_responses_data.csv") with the local path to the 
data file.
